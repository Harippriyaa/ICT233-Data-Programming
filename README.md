# ICT233-Data-Programming

This course introduces students to the language (that is, protocol) adopted in the communication
between a web server and client (browser), called the HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP). Students
will learn to write a program to talk HTTP with web servers to download web pages from the World
Wide Web (WWW). By understanding the format of the web pages in HyperText Markup Language
(HTML), the information in the web pages can be extracted in the form of an object. Students then learn
how to design traditional database and store the information of the objects using the Object-Relational
Mapping (ORM) method. Students will also learn how to Create, Read, Update and Destroy (CRUD)
records of a database system. A data structure, DataFrame, will be introduced so that CRUD operations
on information can be performed through a programming language.
